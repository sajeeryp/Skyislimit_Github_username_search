## Getting Started

This project is a demo project how to search and fetch GitHub User deatils by using GitHub "username" .The point for a Flutter application is to Understand framework and Coding Structure.

A few resources to get you started  this initial Flutter project:


Here, we are using GetX state Management with stateless Class concept. for that requirement we need to use Controllers to manage stateless classes. So this project need to use controllers as well.


Another conept we use Globalization and Common widget concepts. So can reduce code and change code with ease and less code complicity. The use of globalization can use all application controlling with features.

Localizations used this project to use different languages with less efforts and less coding intergrity.

Design Aspects here we use theme controlling using getX. so we can simply manage themes as well. This project is demo design with basic coding stucture.

Rest APIs management can manage services sectors like the "base url" , "endpoint of the url"  others contants variable can easly.

this is short explanation of this project.
